How's it ladies and gents, thanks for your patience. Here is the early release of the custom chams source code, I have also provided a dll for those who don't want to compile (although you should).

Information about materials can be found here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Material_System

As for the code, places of interest are the "ListLeavesInBox" hook for extending chams range & the usage of "CreateMaterial" in hooks.cpp.



Yours truly,
