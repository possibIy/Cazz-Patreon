Hello Patrons,

It's been some time since my last coding tutorial, hence I decided to make this one special. Below you'll find the full source code from the "Your First Kernel Driver" video.

It's a simple IOCTL driver with CS2 bunnyhop included. It will bypass VAC but not much else. The driver is intended to be mapped with kdmapper.

Enjoy!
